# DeadShare - Release Options Integration

## Overview

The Release Options system has been successfully integrated into your DeadShare app. This adds powerful post-decryption control mechanisms while maintaining the zero-trust, client-side architecture.

## What's New

### 1. New Step in Encryption Flow
- **Step 3: Release Options** - Choose what happens after decryption threshold is reached
- This step is optional and can be skipped for standard file sharing

### 2. Five Release Options Available

#### 🧑‍⚖️ **Designated Recipient** (Low Risk)
- Only allow decryption in a specific browser session
- Perfect for digital executor or power of attorney scenarios
- Session ID based authentication

#### ⏰ **Timed Release** (Low Risk)  
- Add delay timer after threshold is reached
- Configurable from 1 hour to 1 year
- Useful for "cooling off" periods or legal requirements

#### 🔥 **Burn After Read** (Medium Risk)
- Allow limited views, then destroy the file
- Configurable view count (1-10)
- Optional burn-on-download

#### 👥 **Multiple Recipients** (Medium Risk)
- Encrypt separately for multiple recipients
- Each gets their own version using their public key
- Perfect for group sharing with individual control

#### 🌐 **Public Release** (High Risk)
- Upload to IPFS, Arweave, or custom endpoint
- Makes file publicly accessible
- Irreversible action

### 3. Enhanced Decryption Handler
- Checks release restrictions before allowing decryption
- Shows real-time status (time remaining, views left, etc.)
- Enforces burn-after-read and timed release policies

## How to Use

1. **Encrypt a file** as usual in Steps 1-2
2. **Configure Release Options** in Step 3 (or skip)
3. **Download shares** in Step 4
4. **Decrypt with restrictions** enforced automatically

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **100% Client-Side**: No backend dependencies
- **Zero-Trust**: All data stored locally in browser
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Modular**: Easy to extend with new release options

### Storage
- Release configs stored in `localStorage`
- Session data in `sessionStorage`  
- All sensitive data cleared after use

### Integration Points
- `src/types/releaseOptions.ts` - Type definitions
- `src/components/ReleaseOptionsManager.tsx` - Main UI component
- `src/components/releaseOptions/` - Individual setup components
- `src/utils/releaseUtils.ts` - Core processing logic
- `src/components/ReleaseOptions.css` - Styling

## Security Considerations

### Designated Recipient
- ✅ Session-based, can't be shared across browsers
- ⚠️ Lost session = lost access (no recovery)

### Timed Release  
- ✅ Timer stored locally, can't be bypassed externally
- ⚠️ User can clear browser data to bypass (by design)

### Burn After Read
- ✅ View counting enforced client-side
- ⚠️ Sophisticated users can bypass by saving before viewing

### Multi-Recipient
- ✅ Each recipient gets individually encrypted version
- ✅ Recipients can't decrypt others' versions
- ⚠️ Requires proper public key management

### Public Release
- ⚠️ **IRREVERSIBLE** - file becomes publicly accessible
- ⚠️ No control over who accesses or redistributes
- ⚠️ Legal implications are user's responsibility

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Added release options step
- `src/types/index.ts` - Extended EncryptionResult
- `src/components/EncryptionHandler.tsx` - Added timestamp
- `src/components/DecryptHandler.tsx` - Added release checking
- `src/components/DecryptHandler.css` - Added restriction styles

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for future versions:
- **Geo-Restriction**: Only allow decryption from specific locations
- **Device Binding**: Bind to specific device fingerprints  
- **Multi-Factor**: Require additional authentication
- **Scheduled Release**: Release at specific date/time
- **Conditional Release**: Release based on external conditions

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Basic Flow**: Encrypt → Skip Release Options → Decrypt
2. **Timed Release**: Set 5 minute timer, verify countdown
3. **Burn After Read**: Set 2 views, verify destruction  
4. **Designated**: Generate session ID, test cross-browser
5. **Multi-Recipient**: Add test public keys, verify encryption

The system is now fully integrated and ready for use! 🎉
